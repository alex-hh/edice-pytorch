This repo contains a pytorch re-implementation of the eDICE model,
introduced in the paper [Getting personal with epigenetics: towards individual-specific epigenomic imputation with machine learning](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-40211-2)

The original tensorflow implementation is [available here](https://github.com/alex-hh/eDICE), has been more thoroughly tested, and should be used for reproduction of results.

The main entrypoint is train_edice.py which can be used to train the eDICE model.
